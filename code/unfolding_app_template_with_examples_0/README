This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder. For more
examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

Get excited and make things!


INSTALLATION

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')

Set the native libraries for your OS ('Configure Build Path' > 'Libraries' > Set 'native library location' of jogl.jar).

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing only works with Java 1.6)
